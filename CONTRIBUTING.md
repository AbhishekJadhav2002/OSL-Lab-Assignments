## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference [Issues](https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Moody-website/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Moody-website/pulls) liberally after the first line.
